# Regression test for the theme source `install` picks (issue #54 follow-up).

# `bash <(curl …/install.sh) install` — the README one-liner — runs from process
# substitution, so get_themes_source() cannot see a local themes/ dir and falls
# back to the ${INSTALL_DIR}/themes cache left by whatever version was installed
# before. Without a download that silently reinstalls stale CSS while stamping
# .version with the running script's VERSION, so `status` reports a version that
# was never installed.
#
# Runnable anywhere with bash + coreutils: `bash test/install_source.test.sh`.
